## Resources:
1. [Metalab](http://metalab.stanford.edu/) including information about the [contribution challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WH6y-7Hq-BRs7PAfH7jJY8qvPdBcy8IeHxfXeaqAJUI/edit)
2. Templates and examples:
- Metadata [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12SpehtoFfIvUjUBHYvi9rnIKeXAYduFdofRlQ0HAh5s/edit)
- PRISMA [flowchart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit#slide=id.p) and [general info](http://prisma-statement.org/) about the PRISMA workflow
- Meta-analysis [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y_2BcFSu48t0F8a_xrY1Ro2fJoCIV1h8O627WNcrjY/edit#gid=0) for final, included studies 
- Literature search [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0) for documenting the process of sorting through potentially relevant papers 

## Materials for our meta-analysis
- Folder of all relevant papers on [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/shared/GwZilR)
-- As you go through each paper, you'll want to **highlight** the portions of text that you're putting into our meta-analysis spreadsheet
- Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/171sHO97PPB4KqR6rAotvKzkTopYL1-km?usp=sharing) with all of our spreadsheets (you'll need to log into babylab2 to access).

## Important things to keep in mind
- Make sure you do not leave stray spaces, capitals, or typos when entering data
- Distinguish between NA (not applicable) and "missing" (applicable but information isn't in paper - a sign that we should ask the authors)
- At least 2 people should go through and verify every entry (Shari will try to be one of those people, but you should team up together too)
- If you have a question about the *literature review* or *scope of the meta-analysis*, ask in Slack, and also make sure to document this in our [Decision Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B__qPqybM8BaMKXqyAFnmgRRJLdAT0iXb6jQDjkwtRI/edit#gid=0)
- If you have a question about *data entry*, ask in Slack, and reference the cell number (e.g. C9) in your question. Also give us information about what you've tried so far (e.g. "I think that xxx should go here because of pg yyy of the paper, but I can't tell whether that number refers to the number of observations or number of babies")
